# PEACE SoundBytes Framework - Deep Reference

Detailed background on Donald Miller's PEACE SoundBytes methodology.

## The House Metaphor

A business works like a house with three parts:

1. **Five Front Steps** — The PEACE SoundBytes that pique curiosity
2. **Front Porch** — Lead magnets, webinars, proposals that build trust
3. **Front Door** — The paywall/conversion point

Without front steps, customers face an 8-foot climb to your porch. Most businesses are missing front steps entirely—they have no repeatable, memorable soundbytes.

## The Hero in a Hole

Every story is about a hero in a hole who needs to get out.

- **Problem** describes the hero in the hole
- **Empathy** is the guide looking into the hole saying "I'm sorry you're down there"
- **Answer** is the guide throwing a rope into the hole
- **Change** is the hero climbing out, transformed
- **End Result** is life above ground

## The Rope Principle

If you give someone a rope with no context, they'll put it in their garage and forget it.

If they're in a hole and you throw down the rope, it becomes the most valuable thing in the world.

**This is why you must start with Problem.** Without establishing the hole, your product (the rope) has no perceived value. "I own a gym" = here's a rope. "I help men in their 50s live 10 years longer" = rope into a hole.

## Framework Rules

### No Nuance
- Black and white thinking only
- Cannot burn mental calories
- "The brain when it has to think burns calories and none of your steps should cause you to burn any calories"

### Start With Problem
Common mistake: "I'm the CEO of [company]" or "I own a gym"

Better: Lead with the problem you solve
- "Have you ever worried about money?"
- "I help men in their 50s add 10 years to their life"
- "I help scrawny tennis players develop the best serve in the game"

### Empathy Creates Connection
"I feel your pain" (Bill Clinton) is remembered 30+ years later.

When someone cares about your problem, you're willing to accept their help. Empathy positions you as the guide, not the hero.

### Change = Controlling Idea
The transformation statement often becomes your tagline.

YNAB: "Get good with money" emerged from the Change step and became the controlling idea for the entire brand.

The controlling idea should be:
- Aspirational—if said about the customer, they love it
- Specific—not generic ("I work with female athletes" → "I make female athletes fast")
- Invertible—can create lead magnets ("5 signs the man you're dating is bad with money")

### Scalability
The same five soundbytes work at any length:
- 8 seconds (elevator pitch)
- 80 minutes (keynote presentation)
- Full documentary

Each soundbyte can be expanded into its own section while maintaining the narrative arc.

## Application Examples

### Gym Owner Transformation

**Before:** "I own a gym"

**After PEACE:**
| Step | SoundByte |
|------|-----------|
| Problem | "I work with men in their 50s who want to live 10 years longer but can't figure out how" |
| Empathy | "I watched my dad get way too old before his time—he wasn't able to communicate with me" |
| Answer | "I started a cohort at my gym called 10 Years Longer" |
| Change | "...that helps men in their 50s add 10 years to their life" |
| End Result | "...so they can be there for their families" |

**Pricing power:** Standard gym = $90/month. "10 Years Longer" cohort = $1,000/month.

### Female Athlete Coach

**Before:** "I work with female athletes"

**After:** "I'm the guy who makes female athletes fast"

The controlling idea (speed) is tangible and applies across sports: volleyball, basketball, tennis, lacrosse, track.

## Where to Deploy SoundBytes

### External
- Website headers
- Business card backs
- Ad copy
- YouTube video intros
- Pitch deck covers
- Proposal covers
- Lead generators
- Social media content
- Email onboarding sequences (5 emails, one per soundbyte)

### Internal
- End of every training session
- Inside the product UI itself
- Sales scripts
- Customer success touchpoints

### Discipline Required
David Salers at Chick-fil-A took **3 years** to execute the "My pleasure" campaign. The hard part isn't writing the soundbytes—it's leaving everything else out and running it like a campaign with discipline.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading with credentials** instead of problem
2. **Explaining nuance** on the front steps (save for the porch)
3. **No empathy statement** — skipping straight to product
4. **Generic transformation** — "we help businesses grow" vs. specific identity
5. **Forgetting the end result** — not painting life after
6. **Rope without hole** — describing product without establishing problem first
7. **Curse of knowledge** — using insider language customers don't understand

## Testing Your SoundBytes

After creating them, ask:
- Can a 4-year-old understand each statement?
- If someone heard these at a cocktail party, would they say "Tell me more"?
- Could 70% of listeners repeat them back after hearing once?
- Does the Change step work as a standalone tagline?
- Is the Problem statement inclusive enough? ("Have you *ever* worried about money?" captures 100% vs. "Are you worried about money?" which might not)
