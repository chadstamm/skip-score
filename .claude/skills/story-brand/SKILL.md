description: Analyze and transform copy using Donald Miller's StoryBrand methodology and PEACE SoundBytes framework. Use when working on messaging, marketing copy, website content, pitch decks, proposals, or any customer-facing communication that needs to position the customer as hero and the brand as guide. Triggers include requests to "run through StoryBrand," improve messaging clarity, create soundbytes, or align copy with story-driven marketing principles.

# StoryBrand Skill

Transform copy into clear, customer-centric messaging using StoryBrand principles.

## Core Principle

**The customer is the hero. You are the guide.**

Never position the brand as hero. The brand throws the rope into the hole—it doesn't climb out of it.

## Three Anchors (Confirm Before Proceeding)

Before any analysis or rewrite, establish:

1. **Hero** — Who is the customer?
2. **Problem** — What hole are they in?
3. **Solution** — What rope are we throwing?

Infer these from existing copy. Flag uncertainty. Confirm all three before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Analyze
- Audit all copy for StoryBrand alignment
- Identify where messaging drifts from hero-centric positioning
- Flag jargon, nuance, or "curse of knowledge" violations
- Draft PEACE SoundBytes as part of findings
- Present summary for approval

### Phase 2: Review
- Checkpoint before any rewrites
- Confirm hero/problem/solution anchors
- Refine PEACE SoundBytes together
- Approve direction

### Phase 3: Rewrite
- Update copy to align with StoryBrand
- Embed approved SoundBytes where appropriate
- Maintain controlling idea throughout

## PEACE SoundBytes Framework

Five modular statements that work as a single sentence AND as standalone pieces.

| Step | Purpose | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **P**roblem | Hook | Describes the hero in a hole |
| **E**mpathy | Guide leans in | Shows you understand their pain |
| **A**nswer | Rope into the hole | Positions your product as solution |
| **C**hange | Transformation | The aspirational identity they gain |
| **E**nd Result | Climactic scene | Life after—the resolved state |

### SoundByte Rules

- **No nuance** — Black and white, bumper-sticker logic
- **Zero mental calories** — A 4-year-old could understand it
- **Start with problem** — Without the hole, the rope has no value
- **Empathy positions you as guide** — "We know how you feel" creates bond
- **Change becomes the controlling idea** — Often your tagline emerges here
- **End result sells the future** — What life looks like after

### Example: YNAB

| Step | SoundByte |
|------|-----------|
| Problem | "Have you ever worried about money?" |
| Empathy | "We know how you feel." |
| Answer | "Download the YNAB app" |
| Change | "...and get good with money" |
| End Result | "...so you'll never worry about money again." |

**Full sentence:** "Have you ever worried about money? We know how you feel. Download the YNAB app and get good with money so you'll never worry about money again."

**Controlling idea:** "Get good with money"

## The House Metaphor

- **Front Steps** (5 PEACE SoundBytes) → Pique curiosity
- **Front Porch** (Lead magnets, webinars, proposals) → Build trust
- **Front Door** (Paywall) → Conversion

The SoundBytes are NOT for explaining nuance. They get people to say: *"That sounds like something I need. Can you tell me more?"*

## Analysis Checklist

When auditing copy, flag:

- [ ] Does it start with the customer's problem or the brand's capabilities?
- [ ] Is empathy present? Does the brand show it understands the pain?
- [ ] Is the product positioned as the answer to a specific problem?
- [ ] Is there a clear transformation/aspirational identity?
- [ ] Is the end result—life after—painted clearly?
- [ ] Is the language simple enough for zero mental calories?
- [ ] Could this be the "rope" without a "hole"? (Product described without problem context)

## Output Format

### Analysis Deliverable

```
## Three Anchors
- **Hero:** [who]
- **Problem:** [what hole]
